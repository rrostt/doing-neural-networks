# Doing Neural Networks

Notebook produced during a seminar called Doing Neural Networks.

The seminar aimed to show what is involved in creating and training neural networks, using pytorch. We trained an image classifier and wrote a GAN to produce images similar to those of MNIST and FashionMNIST.

The seminar was given on 2022-12-07 by Mattias Rost.
